# machine-learning

Titanic Example:
1. Get data of Titanic passengers and survived list
2. Clean data
3. Tensorflow Linear Classifier for prediction
4. Tensorflow DNN for prediction


Text Classification: (15 labels as intents)
1. Get DBpedia data from tensowflow dataset
2. Generate vocabulary list using training data and convert train/test data into equivalent unique ids
3. Use Bag of words model (skip gram) to model train and test data
4. Use RNN to model train and test data to take the context

(Hackerrank competitions) Multi-Label Classification: (12 tags)
1. Read data into pandas dataframe
2. Lower the input sentences
3. Tokenise input sentence and Apply SnowballStemmer on the words
4. Apply Count Vectorizer and then TFIDF to convert it to vector form
5. XGBoost algo applied on the data for prediction. Here any algo can be used from tensorflow
